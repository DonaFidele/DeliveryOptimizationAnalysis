# DeliveryOptimizationAnalysis

The aim of this project is to optimize delivery routes in order to facilitate and accelerate delivery services for customers. It is based on the analysis of two datasets: "trips" and "drivers_activities_logs". The "trips" dataset contains 54 columns and 103894 rows, while "drivers_activities_logs" also includes 13 columns and 21169 rows.

Main objectives :
- In-depth analysis of datasets to identify trends and insights relevant to optimizing deliveries.
- Use data analysis techniques to identify the most efficient routes and reduce delivery times.
- Evaluate driver and vehicle performance to identify opportunities to improve operational efficiency.
- Propose data-driven recommendations to optimize delivery processes and improve the customer experience.
